## Component Based Architecture
Practice of building software based on reusable components of code.
**Each component consists of well-defined functionality that can be inserted into an application without requiring modifcation of other components**

**React manpulates the virtual DOM when necessary to update the browser DOM minizing the updates**

Every react component must reneder atleast one component called **Root Component**

Javascript XML JSX (Combination of HTML and Javascript)
A react component won,t render untill its used as an JSX element.
First letter of component name must be  **Capitalized**
First letter of function name must be  **Capitalized**
Capitalized name - treated as jsx 
Non-capitalized - treated as normal HTML component
